                        <br>From 2016 to September 2018, the sale of <b>hamburger</b> is in a increasing trend. However, in <b>October 2018</b>, 
                        there is a steep descreasing slope. Besides hamburger, chicken fillet and fish fillet also increases throughout the years and 
                        have a small descreasing trend in October 2018. However, the sale of chicken fillet does not varies that much comparing to the hamburger. 
                        <br>
                        <br>Besides it, as the graph shows, United States tend to have more sales on hamburger. Because it is similar to Impossible Burger, it is 
                        affected by itthe most when it is released (October 2018).

                        <br><span>Suggestions: </span> The trends for chicken fillet and fish fillet do not increase throughout years. Therefore, I would suggest that 
                        McDonald's to introduce new chicken fillet and fish fillet to gain more sales. Besides this, I would also recommend McDonald's to introduce new 
                        burger that is similar to the Impossible Burger to bring back the consumers.

                        <br> As the Impossible Burger released in October 2018, the sales of the hamburgers in McDonald's significantly <b>decreases</b> from September to
                         October. Fortunately, in the next month, the sales of the hamburger brings a little bit back.

                        <br> However, looking back to the first graph, the total sales still do not go back to the status of sales before September 2018. The sales of the 
                        McDonald's are still affected by the Impossible Burger.

                <span>Conclusion:</span> The Burger King's Impossible Burger still bring affects to the McDonald's in the 
                long term. The total sales do not bring back to the point before October 2018 and stay in the lower sales. 
                Therefore, I would suggest McDonald's should introduce a burger that is similar to the Impossible Burger 
                to gain the consumer. Besides this, the chicken fillet and fish fillet do not gain sales over the years. 
                So, McDonald should also introduce new versions of these two to gather more consumers.
